# Ruby loops

Hi there!

Here's one of the first projects done during [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) bootcamp.

At that time, the aim was to practice **Ruby loops** and, overall, get familiar with backend programming language.

It feels kinda weird to me to check it out now, but at the same time it makes me realize the progress made since then.

At the end of the day, we all gotta start somewhere right!
